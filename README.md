Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Karthik Nadar, and I'm a full stack web developer based in India. I'm passionate about staying up to date with the latest trends in the tech industry and sharing my knowledge with others. That's why I publish weekly technical blogs on Hashnode that cover topics like web development, DevOps, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

When it comes to programming languages, I'm skilled in C, C++, Java, and Python. As a MERN stack developer, I specialize in building web applications using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

Currently, I'm focused on expanding my knowledge of DevOps. I've already familiarized myself with computer networking, GitHub commands, Linux, and YAML, and I'm currently learning Docker.

If you want to learn more about my work and interests, be sure to check out my Twitter profile at https://twitter.com/Karthikreincar1. Thank you for visiting my profile!.
