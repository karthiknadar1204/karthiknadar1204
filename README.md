# Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm **Karthik Nadar**, a passionate Backend, AI, and Cloud Engineer. I thrive at the intersection of scalable infrastructure and cutting-edge machine learning, and I’m always exploring ways to bridge traditional systems with intelligent, agentic solutions.

## 🚀 About Me

I started my journey in full-stack and backend development — building resilient architectures using **Express.js**, **FastAPI**, and **Python**, and crafting frontend interfaces with **React** and **Next.js**. Over time, I developed a strong foundation in **DevOps** and **Cloud Infrastructure**, which helped me design systems that scale and stay reliable in production.

Now, my focus is on building intelligent systems — combining the best of AI, automation, and backend architecture.

## 🛠 Cloud & DevOps Expertise

My cloud and infrastructure toolkit includes:

| **Category**   | **Technologies**                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compute**    | EC2, EKS                                             |
| **Networking** | VPC, Route53                                         |
| **Storage**    | S3                                                   |
| **CI/CD**      | Jenkins, GitHub Actions                              |
| **Automation** | Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Chef, Terraform, Puppet |

I enjoy building robust CI/CD pipelines, automating workflows, and using orchestration tools to streamline development and deployment.

## 🤖 Machine Learning & AI Systems

### 🧠 ML & Generative AI

* **Deep Learning**: Built and fine-tuned CNN models for computer vision tasks
* **Generative AI**: Worked with GANs, VAEs, energy-based models, and diffusion models
* **Text-to-Image**: Fine-tuned diffusion models using **LoRA**, **DreamBooth**, and custom pipelines for creative generation

### 🤖 Agentic Workflows & AI Infrastructure

I'm deeply involved in building **AI agents and agentic systems** — crafting workflows that go beyond simple prompt-response setups. I’ve worked extensively with:

* **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, **LangSmith**
* **Vercel AI SDK** for full-stack agent deployment
* **Vector databases** like **Pinecone** for fast and accurate RAG pipelines
* **Local LLM orchestration** using **Ollama**
* Designing and optimizing **chunking strategies** and **retrieval flows**

This is where I love to geek out — building smart, modular systems that reason, plan, and act. I see agents as the next layer of app intelligence, and I’m all-in on exploring that space.
