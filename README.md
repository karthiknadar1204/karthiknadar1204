## About Me

I’m **Karthik Nadar**, a backend, AI, and cloud engineer who loves building systems that actually *work at scale*.

I started coding in my **second year of college**, right after almost being ousted in the first round of my first-ever hackathon. That moment stung — but it lit a fire in me to never be underprepared again.

I began with **React** and **JavaScript**, building small projects that taught me how things worked under the hood. Soon after, I joined **GirlScript Summer of Code**, a local open-source initiative, where I ranked **22nd among 1000+ contributors**. That was my first milestone — proof that persistence compounds.

From there, I went deeper into **backend engineering** with **Express.js** and **FastAPI**, built full-stack apps, and learned the hard lessons of debugging, scaling, and deployment. Around this time, I stumbled into **AI** — and it changed everything.

##  My Journey into AI & Systems Engineering

My first real AI project was a small-scale clone of **Perplexity’s search system**. I sketched the entire architecture on my notebook during my microprocessor class and then in my dorm wardrobe — from the data flow to the agentic workflow — and then brought it to life in code.
That was my “lightbulb” moment: realizing I could build something end-to-end that thinks.

Later, I competed in **HackRx 5.0**, hosted at **Bajaj Finserv HQ (Pune)**, where I was among the **top 22 teams across India**. We built an **AI video generator** using **Next.js**, **Python**, and **Remotion**, another project that started out with an architecture drawing on my wardrobeto builting multiple iterations to see what works and what doesn't.

Soon after, at **HackByte 3.0 (IIIT Jabalpur)**, I built **DataShorts** — a platform that lets you **converse with your database in natural language**. Competing among **300+ teams**, we placed **4th nationwide**, and the project was praised for its chunking strategy, retrieval design, and clean architecture.

That hackathon project is now evolving into my personal venture — **[datashorts.com](https://datashorts.com)** — where I’m building an intelligent interface between humans and structured data.

##  What I’m Building & Exploring
I believe that *the next leap in AI won’t come from bigger models — but from agents that remember.*

I’ve been diving deep into AI memory systems and personalization, inspired by the Mem0 research paper, experimenting with:

* Vector memory upsertion and relevance scoring
* Tool-calling for selective long-term retention
* Graph-based memory relationships
* Context summarization pipelines

These experiments aim to answer one question:

> “How can we make AI *remember* like humans — contextually, intelligently, and efficiently?”

##  Reverse Engineering Developer Tools

One of my favorite learning methods is to reverse-engineer the tools I admire.

I’ve built smaller-scale clones of:

* LangSmith → to understand how LLM tracing and observability platforms work,made me realise how there is so much more to ai than just calling apis and models.
* Perplexity → for retrieval, contextual Q&A, and agentic orchestration,my first intro to agentic systems and how memory is maintained across agents.
* AWS S3 wrapper → for simplified cloud storage APIs,super exciting to actually get over the complex s3 setup and build something that does the same in a single click.

These projects taught me why great systems feel simple— they hide the complexity behind clarity.
